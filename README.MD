## ⚙️ Internal Concept

- Each digital wolf is defined by a binary vector of 24 features.
- These features can represent human-like traits (kindness, aggression, awareness...).
- The "group scent" results from the influence of each wolf's code.
- Each interaction between two groups is a simulation scenario resulting in a Boolean outcome.
- The logic allows abstraction, substitution, compression, and pattern recognition over massive symbolic structures.

## 📌 Final Note

DSCE proposes a new path to understand and simulate decision-making processes beyond conventional logic gates.  
It is not a classification method only — it is a symbolic evolutionary ecosystem.


# 🧠 DSCE-HC: Hash Compression Branch of DSCE Theory

## 🌍 Introduction

DSCE-HC (Hash Compression) is a new computational branch within the broader DSCE (Digital Symbolic Cognitive Ecosystem) theory. It provides a novel method for symbolically compressing and classifying high-dimensional cognitive entities—such as digital wolves (TWolf)—into minimal, yet uniquely decodable, symbolic hashes.

---

## 🧩 Core Idea

Instead of comparing individual features in isolation, DSCE-HC compresses the **entire cognitive structure** (including behavior, environment, and group influence) into a **single symbolic hash**.

This allows:
- Simplification of massive symbolic datasets (millions of TWolf records)
- Rapid classification into symbolic containers ("buckets")
- Reversible decoding using a mathematical or logical key

---

## 🏗️ Key Concepts

- **TWolf**: A digital entity with multidimensional symbolic features and group contexts.
- **Symbolic Hash**: A unique, reversible digital code that represents a full TWolf instance.
- **Symbolic Containers**: Each hash is classified into 1 of ~1000 known categories ("containers").
- **Hash Engine**: A mathematical engine that compresses and later re-generates TWolf records.

---

## ⚙️ Functional Pipeline

1. **Input**: 1,000,000+ TWolf records (each with group context and result).
2. **Hash Generation**: Compress each record into a symbolic numeric code.
3. **Key Training**: Train a mathematical key to reverse engineer each hash to:
   - The original TWolf
   - Or its decision result (`rezult`)
4. **Classification**: Each hash falls into one of ~1000 unique symbolic buckets.

## 🚀 Why It’s Revolutionary

- Goes beyond statistical machine learning.
- Enables scalable symbolic reasoning.
- Bridges data compression with symbolic cognition.
- Achieves generalization without losing symbolic granularity.

## 📘 Status

> DSCE-HC is currently a research subfield under active conceptualization by **Kamel Guizani**.
