## ⚙️ Internal Concept

- Each digital wolf is defined by a binary vector of 24 features.
- These features can represent human-like traits (kindness, aggression, awareness...).
- The "group scent" results from the influence of each wolf's code.
- Each interaction between two groups is a simulation scenario resulting in a Boolean outcome.
- The logic allows abstraction, substitution, compression, and pattern recognition over massive symbolic structures.

## 📌 Final Note

DSCE proposes a new path to understand and simulate decision-making processes beyond conventional logic gates.  
It is not a classification method only — it is a symbolic evolutionary ecosystem.
